This can be problematic especially when it gets to mapping updates\netc. when a node sends a mapping update to the master but while the request\nis in-flight the index changes for whatever reason we would still apply the update\nsince we use the name of the index to identify the index in the clusterstate.\nThe problem is that index names can be reused which happens in practice and sometimes\neven in a automated way rendering this problem as realistic.\nIn this change we resolve the index including it's UUID as early as possible in places\nwhere changes to the clusterstate are possible. For instance mapping updates on a node use a\nconcrete index rather than it's name and the master will fail the mapping update iff\nthe index can't be found by it's <name, uuid> tuple.\n\nCloses #17048\n",

The logic has been cleaned up and simplified were was possible without breaking bwc.\n\nAlso the notion of aliasOrIndex has been changed to index expression.\n\nThe IndexNameExpressionResolver translates index name expressions into concrete indices. The list of index name expressions are first delegated to the known ExpressionResolverS. An ExpressionResolver is responsible for translating if possible an expression into another expression (possibly but not required this can be concrete indices or aliases) otherwise the expressions are left untouched. Concretely this means converting wildcard expressions into concrete indices or aliases, but in the future other implementations could convert expressions based on different rules.\n\nTo prevent many overloading of methods, DocumentRequest extends now from IndicesRequest. All implementation of DocumentRequest already did implement IndicesRequest indirectly.\n",
