In this new implementation, the connection\nmanagement will be very different, in particular, there may be multiple\npacks received on a single open connection. So, hoist out as much as we\ncan from ReceivePack, mostly just leaving behind the single-connection\nversion in that class.\n\nChange-Id: I5567aad6ae77951f73f59c1f91996d934ea88334\n",
