MockHandler API currently is a semi public API. Technically it lives in public package but the documentation clearly states that users should not provide own implementations. Internally, Mockito always casts MockHandler into InternalMockHandler. This is a dealbreaker for Powermockito (see https://github.com/powermock/powermock/blob/68d988b9cb6a20007d9387d01ded9cc6f7781e5c/powermock-api/powermock-api-mockito2/src/main/java/org/powermock/api/mockito/mockmaker/PowerMockMaker.java#L57).\n2. InternalMockHandler is internal because it leaks internal StubbedInvocationMatcher API. This change makes InternalMockHandler ready to be converted into public API. We can start using Stubbing interface in place of StubbedInvocationMatcher. Stubbing interface was introduced this year, it was not available when we created MockMaker plugin.\n3. This change makes Stubbing interface additionally extend Answer. This adds \"answer()\" method to Stubbing. Stubbings can give answers so it is a good change from the standpoint of the model\n",
